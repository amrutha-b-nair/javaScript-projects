# JavaScript Learning Projects

Welcome to the JavaScript Learning Projects repository! This repository contains a collection of small projects aimed at helping you learn and practice JavaScript. Each project focuses on different aspects of JavaScript programming, ranging from basic concepts to more advanced topics. Feel free to explore the projects, experiment with the code, and expand upon them to further enhance your skills.

## Project List

1. **Project 1: Palindrome Checker**
   - Description: A Palindrome Checker is a program that determines whether a given string is a palindrome or not. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward.
   - Concepts Covered: String manipulation, loops, conditionals.
   - Project idea is from [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-v8/build-a-palindrome-checker-project/build-a-palindrome-checker)

2. **Project 2: Roman Numeral Converter**
   - Description: A Roman Numeral Converter is a program that converts a given number to its equivalent Roman numeral representation. Roman numerals are a numeral system that originated in ancient Rome, where letters represent values.
   - Concepts Covered: Algorithms, arrays, loops.
   - Project idea is from [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-v8/build-a-roman-numeral-converter-project/build-a-roman-numeral-converter)

## Getting Started

To get started with the projects, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/javaScript-projects.git
    ```
